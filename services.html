    <h4>From the very beginning</h4>
    <p>We have patients of all ages,
including the very young. If your infant has trouble latching on when nursing, an upper lip tie or tongue tie can be the culprit.
We offer laser correction for this. Having ties corrected can also
prevent orthodontic problems later on. We're here to give you
instruction on proper care for your child's gums and teeth.

  <ul>
    <li>Your child's dental health depends less on what they eat and more on how often they eat it.</li>
    <li>Bacteria ("sugar bugs") in dental plaque break down ALL foods to produce acids. This
bacterial acid, can lead to cavities if left on the teeth for 20 minutes or more.</li>
    <li>If you child is a snacker or grazer, they need to brushoften an drink lots of water!... (perhaps a toothbrush in the kitchen?)</li>
    <li>Some healthy snacks are cheese, vegetables, yogurt, and peanut butter.</li>
    <li>Beware of liquid candy (juice, soda pop, energy drinks, Gatorade, sweet tea, lemonade, and
chocolate milk): These beverages lead to more dental decay and a "sweet tooth" that can be hard to break!</li>
    <li>Provide a balanced diet and save foods with refined sugar or starch for meal times.</li>
